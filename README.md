# Heart Disease Prediction

This machine learning project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health parameters such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization techniques using different classifiers.

## Features:
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Model training using Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest
- Cross-validation and performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)
- Visualization of feature importance and classification metrics

## Installation

To run the project, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1) Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
```
2) Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd heart-disease-prediction
```

3) Run the Python script:

```
python heart_disease_prediction.py
```

## Results
The program outputs various classification metrics and visualizations, including a bar plot showing the feature importance.
